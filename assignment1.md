# Assignment 1: Event Management System

**Deadline:** 12th Feb 2026  
**Submission:** Single ZIP file

## Part - 1: Core System Implementation [70 Marks]

### 1. Introduction
Club Council have a long-standing tradition of somehow managing a large number of events, clubs, and participants, though with a generous dose of chaos. As Felicity draws closer, this chaos tends to take familiar forms: midnight Google Forms, barely comprehensible spreadsheets, and important information vanishing into the depths of WhatsApp groups. The result is predictable, participants are never quite sure whether they are registered, organizers are unsure who is actually attending, and payments exist in a vague limbo of "screenshots for confirmation."

With the upcoming fest approaching and the Felicity Tech Team's patience wearing thin, it has finally been decided that something must change. You have been appointed to save the fest from this organizational mess by designing a system that brings order to the madness: a centralized platform that allows clubs to conduct events smoothly and participants to register, track, and attend them without relying on a heroic combination of Google Forms, spreadsheets, and hope.

### 2. Technology Stack
The system must be implemented using the MERN stack:
1. **MongoDB** – Database
2. **Express.js** – Backend framework implementing REST APIs
3. **React / React-based framework** – Frontend
4. **Node.js** – Runtime

## Part - 2: Advanced Features [30 Marks]

### Instructions
The following features are organized into three tiers. You must implement features from each tier as specified below to achieve exactly 30 marks. Clearly mention in your README.md which features you have implemented from each tier along with justification of your choices.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Tier A:** Choose 2 features (8 marks each = 16 marks)
- **Tier B:** Choose 2 features (6 marks each = 12 marks)
- **Tier C:** Choose 1 feature (2 marks)

**Total:** 16 + 12 + 2 = 30 Marks

### 13.1 Tier A: Core Advanced Features [Choose 2 — 8 Marks Each]

Select any 2 features from this tier. These features demonstrate advanced workflow management and complex business logic.

#### 1. Hackathon Team Registration [8 Marks]
Support for team-based event registration where a team leader creates a team, sets the team size, and invites members via a unique code or link. Registration is marked complete only when all invited members accept and the team is fully formed. Include team management dashboard, invite tracking, and automatic ticket generation for all team members upon completion.

#### 2. Merchandise Payment Approval Workflow [8 Marks]
Implement a payment verification system for merchandise purchases. Users must upload a payment proof (image) after placing an order, upon which the order enters a Pending Approval state. Organizers can view a separate tab with all orders showing uploaded payment proofs, current status (Pending/Approved/Rejected), and actions to approve or reject payments. On approval, the order is marked Successful, stock is decremented, a ticket with QR is generated, and a confirmation email is sent. No QR is generated while the order is in pending or rejected state.

#### 3. QR Scanner & Attendance Tracking [8 Marks]
Implement a built-in QR code scanner for organizers to validate tickets and track attendance during events. Features include: scanning participant QR codes (using device camera or file upload), marking attendance with timestamp, rejecting duplicate scans, live attendance dashboard showing scanned vs. not-yet-scanned participants, export attendance reports as CSV, and manual override option for exceptional cases with audit logging.

### 13.2 Tier B: Real-time & Communication Features [Choose 2 — 6 Marks Each]

Select any 2 features from this tier. These features demonstrate real-time communication and collaborative functionalities.

#### 1. Real-Time Discussion Forum [6 Marks]
Implement a real-time discussion forum on the Event Details page where registered participants can post messages, ask questions, and interact. Organizers can moderate the forum (delete/pin messages), post announcements, and respond to queries. Include notification system for new messages, message threading support, and ability to react to messages.

#### 2. Organizer Password Reset Workflow [6 Marks]
Implement a complete password reset system for organizers. Organizers can request password reset from the Admin; Admin can view all password reset requests with details (club name, date, reason); Admin can approve or reject requests with comments; upon approval, system auto-generates new password which Admin receives and shares with the organizer; includes request status tracking (Pending/Approved/Rejected) and password reset history.

#### 3. Team Chat [6 Marks]
Implement a real-time chat system for hackathon teams (requires Tier A Feature 1). Team members can communicate within their team chat room after team formation. Features include real-time message delivery, message history, online status indicators, typing indicators, notification for new messages, and ability to share files/links within the team.
